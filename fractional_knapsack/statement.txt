Given a set of items and total capacity of a knapsack, find the maximal value of fractions of items that fit into the knapsack.
 
The first line of the input contains the number n of items and the capacity W of a knapsack. The next n lines define the values and weights of the items. The i-th line contain integers vi and wi — the value and the weight of i-th item, respectively. 
 
Constraints. 1 <= n <= 1000 , 0 <= W, vi, wi <= 2 *1000,000 for all 1 <= i <= n. All the numbers are integers.
 
Output the maximal value of fractions of items that fit into the knapsack. Round your item to the largest smaller integer if output is fractional
  
Sample Explanation: We will take 1/3rd of item with value 500 and weight 30. So Output would be 500/3 = int(166.67) = 166
