Given an array, find the nearest smaller element G[i] for every element A[i] in the array such that the element has an index smaller than i.

More formally,

G[i] for an element A[i] = an element A[j] 
such that j is maximum possible AND 
j < i AND
A[j] < A[i]

Elements for which no smaller element exist, consider next smaller element as -1
